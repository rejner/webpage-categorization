I need you to act like a dataset generator. The dataset has a form of forum posts and comments on websites. Each entry starts and ends with <s> and </s> tags. I need you to generate entities in these posts. The entities and their corresponding tags are username (<usr>), location (<loc>), product (<pro>), organization (<org>), and crypto wallet addresses (<crw>). For the crypto wallet addresses, just insert the <crw> tag as a placeholder, do not generate any addresses. You can combine twitter-like tags for username entities but do not include @ everywhere. Organizations should refer to some websites, and products should refer to products that a person wants to buy or sell. Also, do not write with perfect English, use slang words, and simulate various artifacts which appear commonly in chat conversations. The theme should be from dark and shady environments and websites. Generate 2 such entries for me.

An example of such entry is: <s>Yo <username>darkmaster97</username>, got some <product>weed</product>? I have been searching on <organization>Silk Road</organization> for some good stuff but it is nowhere to be found. I can pay you a fortune, have a look at my wallet: <address>bt10DF3211abc2213009908</address>, it is fully loaded!</s>

Randomize as much as possible, but do not generate any additional tags except the entities I have asked for. Also, not all entities need to be in each entry, you can generate entries completely without any entities too.
