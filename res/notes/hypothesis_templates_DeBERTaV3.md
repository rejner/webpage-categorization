I am using textual entailment model which uses hypothesis to determine if label is true of false. So far the best hypothesis I have found is  "This text examines the topic of {} in depth.", where a specific category gets inserted into {} braces. For my set of labels: ['religion', 'medicine', 'forsale', 'motorcycles', 'computer', 'politics', 'sport', 'guns', 'cars'], the f1 score is 0.75, precision is 0.65 and recall is 0.88. Can you try to generate a prompt which could resolve in a better score?



Certainly, here is a prompt that you could try using to improve your model's performance:

"Based on the information provided in the text, would you say that {} is a relevant topic to discuss?"

In this prompt, you can replace the {} with each of your labels to create a specific hypothesis for each category. This prompt is designed to be more flexible, allowing your model to capture a wider range of possible expressions that might indicate whether a given label is relevant to the text. Additionally, this prompt uses a more natural language construction that might be more representative of how people actually talk about topics, which could help improve your model's accuracy.

I recommend testing this prompt with your dataset and comparing the results with your current approach to see if it leads to any improvements in performance.



For the prompt "Based on the information provided in the text, would you say that {} is a relevant topic to discuss?", the mertics are: 
F1: 0.414675096528629                                                                                                                                                                                          
Precision: 0.2792658730158728
Recall: 0.805

Can you try something else?




Sure, here's another prompt that you could try using:

"Does the text provide any information about {}?"

This prompt is designed to be more direct and specific, focusing on whether the text contains any information relevant to the given label. By using this prompt, your model may be better able to identify instances where the text provides information about a particular topic, even if it doesn't use explicit language to discuss that topic.

I recommend testing this prompt with your dataset and comparing the results with your previous approaches to see if it leads to any improvements in performance. Keep in mind that different prompts may work better for different labels, so it may be helpful to experiment with several different prompts to find the best one for each category.






I would not use any questions as a prompt. The model predicts the positive/negative entailment of the hypothesis. Using a question can be really confusing.




I apologize for the confusion. Here's another possible prompt that you can use for your task:

"The text provides information about {}."

This prompt is more straightforward and may help your model better capture instances where the text provides information about a particular category. The use of a declarative statement instead of a question can also help to eliminate any potential confusion or ambiguity in the prompt.

I suggest evaluating the performance of your model using this new prompt and comparing the results with the previous ones to determine whether it results in any improvement in accuracy, precision, and recall for your set of labels.






Great! The metrics are getting better for the prompt: The text provides information about {}.

F1: 0.8340246527098416
Precision: 0.7286666666666668
Recall: 0.975

Based on this information, can you provide another guess for increasing the performance?





I'm glad to hear that the new prompt is helping to improve your model's performance! Here's another prompt that you can try:

"The text discusses {}."

This prompt is similar to the previous one but uses a different verb to convey the idea that the text covers a particular category. Using different verbs can help your model to better capture the nuances of language and improve its ability to identify relevant information in the text.

I recommend testing this prompt with your dataset and comparing the results with the previous approaches to see if it leads to any further improvements in performance. Additionally, you may want to consider experimenting with different variations of this prompt, such as "The text mentions {}" or "The text explores {}," to see if they perform better for certain categories.





There was indeed an improvement with them prompt "The text discusses {}."

F1: 0.8653397129186603
Precision: 0.8016666666666667
Recall: 0.94

Any other suggestions?




Great to hear that there was an improvement with the new prompt!

Here's another prompt that you could try:

"The text contains information relevant to {}."

This prompt uses a more flexible language construction, which may help your model better identify instances where the text provides information that is relevant to a particular category. It also emphasizes the relevance of the information to the category, which may help to reduce false positives in your model's predictions.

I suggest testing this prompt with your dataset and comparing the results with the previous approaches to see if it leads to any further improvements in performance. Additionally, you may want to consider experimenting with different variations of this prompt, such as "The text includes information about {}" or "The text provides details about {}," to see if they perform better for certain categories.







This is and interesting prompt, but it caused precision to drop significantly. Note that the precision is calculated as true_positives / num_predictions, recall is true_positives / num_true_labels. F1 is calculated in a standard way. For the prompt "The text contains information relevant to {}.", the metrics are:

F1: 0.6467982279500605
Precision: 0.47797619047619055
Recall: 1.0





I see, thank you for letting me know about the drop in precision.

In that case, here's another prompt that you can try:

"The text provides insights into {}."

This prompt uses the term "insights" to suggest that the text contains valuable information or perspectives on a particular category. The use of a more specific and descriptive term may help your model better identify relevant information in the text and improve its overall performance.

I suggest testing this prompt with your dataset and comparing the results with the previous approaches to see if it leads to any improvements in performance. Additionally, you may want to consider experimenting with different variations of this prompt, such as "The text offers information about {}" or "The text presents a perspective on {}," to see if they perform better for certain categories.





For "The text provides insights into {}." the metrics are:
