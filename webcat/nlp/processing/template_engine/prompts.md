The raw text is separated by newline characters and the desired output is a JSON object in the format [{"post-title": "some title", "post-author": "some author", "post-message": "some message"}, ...]. Your task is to segment the raw text and extract the required information from each segment. Remember that each segment contains only one part of the required information.
